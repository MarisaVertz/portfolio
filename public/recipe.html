    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A banger of a playlist with all of her best "rock on" songs</li><br>
      <li>THE outfit - preferably something with a “wow” factor. Sparkles help.</li><br>
      <li>Three or four inspirational videos of husbands <b>surprising</b> their wives with concert tickets</li><br>
      <li>An “urgent” email about the concert tickets going on sale soon (because urgency makes him act fast)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Begin playing her music regularly at home, in the car, or even when he’s working. Let him <i>accidentally</i> hear it often.</li><br>
      <li>Start wearing the outfit, like weekly. Think of it as a “look at how adorable I am, and how much you want to make me happy” type of ensemble. Make him start wondering when/where you could wear it out. Plant the seed, set the tone. Did I mention that sparkles help?</li><br>
      <li>Carefully schedule those videos. Send him one right after you made him breakfast, after you did him a favor, etc. <b>Timing is key</b>.</li><br>
      <li>We both know you're already subscribed to the Swiftie inbox list. Get ready to forward him that flashy email when the tickets go on sale. Catch him on a real good day.. like those biweekly Fridays or something, youknowwhatimean?👀</li>
     </ol>
