                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Aegon the Conqueror, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Protector of the House—known lovingly as Eggy—began his journey far from the comfort of his kingdom. When we rescued him, weighing less than a single pound, his tiny body battled against a host of challenges: anemia, tapeworm, roundworm, fleas, giardia, and coccidia. His fragile legs wobbled beneath him, and there were concerns he might have cerebral hyperplasia, making it nearly impossible for him to stand on his own. Yet, even then, there was a fire in his eyes—a conqueror's spirit, unyielding and unbroken.</p>
                <p>In time, as he grows stronger and claims his place as ruler of the household, he will earn his full title. For now, he goes by Eggy, a name that suits his small stature and playful nature. He also proudly answers to a collection of other nicknames: Egg Sandwich, Mumpkin Pumpkin, and Kitten Kitten—each a tribute to the joy and resilience he’s brought into our lives.</p>

                        <h3>Aegon's First Day Home</h3>
                        <img src="./assets/images/eggy06.jpg" alt="black kitten" width="300"/>
                        <p>Bringing Aegon home was a day filled with both excitement and urgency. His tiny body, barely a pound, felt impossibly light in our hands as we carried him into his new life. Wrapped in warmth and cradled with care, he settled into his blankets, blinking up at us with wide, trusting eyes. Despite his fragile state, there was a spark of determination that shone through. We began his long journey to recovery that very day, administering the first of many medicines. Aegon's first day home marked the beginning of his rise to strength, a testament to his unyielding spirit and the hope that even the most vulnerable can overcome the greatest of challenges.</p>

                        <h3>Aegon's First Bath</h3>
                        <img src="./assets/images/eggy04.jpg" alt="black kitten" width="300"/>
                        <p>Aegon’s first bath was an endeavor neither of us will forget. His tiny frame, so delicate and thin, was gently placed into the warm water, and for a moment, he seemed bewildered by the sensation. Where fleas scattered, revealing patches of bare skin and layers of grime on his weightless body, we gently began washing away the rough start he had endured. He braved the water with surprising calm, as if he knew this was part of his transformation. Wrapped up tightly in a towel afterward, his tiny body fit snugly in our hands. Clean, warm, and safe, Aegon had taken his first step toward a life of comfort and care.</p>

                        <img src="./assets/images/eggy03.jpg" alt="black kitten" width="300"/>
                        <p>Watching Aegon grow stronger has been nothing short of miraculous. For several months, his legs wobbled with every step, and his head bobbed uncertainly as he tried to find his balance. But with every passing day, as he conquered rounds of medication and hearty meals, his strength began to blossom. The once-fragile kitten started exploring his surroundings, his paws growing steadier and his spirit bolder. Now, he charges through the house with the confidence and curiosity of a conqueror, claiming soft pillows and sunny spots as his own. His journey from fragile to fierce is a reminder that even the smallest warriors can rise up to claim their kingdom.</p>
